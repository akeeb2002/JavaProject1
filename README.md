# JavaProject1
This is a project i did in my "object-orientated Programming in Java" class that i am taking this fall 2021 semester

It takes the numbers of numerical dates from a text file and prints them in the order of oldest to newest in a GUI

Look at the specfic file from the order of Project1.java to DateGUI.Java to Date212.Java and lastly the TextFileInput.Java which helps us run the rest of the code
